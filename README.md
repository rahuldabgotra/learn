# Learn Repository

Welcome to my **Learn Repository**! This is a practical space where I document my journey in learning various programming languages and technologies through code snippets, projects, and resources.

## Introduction

This repository reflects my commitment to expanding my technical skills through hands-on experience. I actively engage in coding exercises, small projects, and experiments across different programming languages, organized into folders for easy navigation.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that the necessary compilers and interpreters for the respective programming languages are installed on your machine.

### How to Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/LearnRepo.git
```

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the respective language folder (C++, Java, or Python) to access the programs and projects.
2. Each project may contain a README file with specific instructions on how to run or execute the code.
3. In the labs directory, you will find folders dedicated to specific lab assignments or algorithms. Each folder contains the relevant code file for that lab, clearly named to indicate which lab it corresponds to.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome to improve and expand the repository. To contribute:

1. **Fork the repository**.
2. **Create a feature branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   ```

3. **Make your changes** and commit them.
4. **Submit a pull request**.

### Contribution Guidelines

- Follow best coding practices for each programming language.
- Ensure that the code is well-documented and includes comments where necessary.

## Resources

I have compiled helpful resources, including online tutorials, documentation, and articles relevant to the technologies I’m studying. Check them in the [Resources](resources.md) file.
